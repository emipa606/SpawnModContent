I made this mostly for my own use but perhaps it can be of use for someone else as well. 

It adds an extra dev-option similar to the vanilla "Make colony"-action with the difference that you can select what mod to load items from. It can for example be useful to check all items in a mod before publishing it.

It will spawn: 


- A power-grid covering the map
- A power-node to the power-grid with 900000W power for testing
- All items
- All buildings (adding recipes to all workbenches)
- A pawn from each race
- All terrain definitions



Compared to the vanilla colony-action it will also work regardless of map-size and will spawn all items instead of just filling a 33x33 square.
